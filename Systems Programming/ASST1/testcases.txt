Workload D:

	This workload attempts to randomly allocate memory sizes between 0 and 10 bytes, 
    storing the pointers in an array. Once a call to malloc() fails, the workload 
    will stop trying to allocate more memory and free all of the pointers.


Workload E:

	This function covers the following steps:

        Loop 10 times through a series of malloc() and free() workload calls:
            - Allocate memory blocks until its reach's the end of the virtual memory available
            - Free every other memory block
            - Allocate memory blocks in chunks of 25
            - Free all allocated memory
